### A collection of selected projects and exercises

But first, a little about me: I love being and playing outside and exploring my surroundings,
be they city streets, urban parks, or open wilderness. I also like encouraging and empowering
others to do the same. I am currently pursuing software development as an endlessly fascniating
tool to achieve that end. That is, I want to use technology to help people be more engaged in 
their analog actiities.
I am a full-stack Javascript developer with the most experience working on the front end with
JS frameworks like React for web and React Native for iOS and Android.
